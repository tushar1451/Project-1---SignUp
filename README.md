# Project-1---SignUp
Version 1.0:
Push date: Tuesday, June 18.
Version Info: Got the primitive functionality of the project done, right now, the signup and login system works, and both functinslities only accept a username and password for now. The system uses library bcrypt to hash the password and jsonWebToken to create the token to return to the user. 
What's next? The sign-up system will use Username, Email and Password, all of which will be validated for certain conditions.
